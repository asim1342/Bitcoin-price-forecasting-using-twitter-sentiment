# Bitcoin-price-forecasting-using-twitter-sentiment

Are you interested in predicting Bitcoin prices based on social media sentiment analysis? Our project aimed to do just that! We collected over 107,000 tweets per minute interval from January to September 2020, preprocessed them using advanced techniques like Vader sentiment analysis and keyword extraction, and stored them in a MySQL database.

To prepare the data for modeling, we resampled it at 8-hour intervals and converted it into a supervised dataset, using features like opening and closing prices, user follower count, user friend count, and sentiment score. For modeling, we used deep learning techniques like Recurrent neural networks (RNN) and Long short term memory (LSTM) to predict future prices based on past data.

Our analysis showed a clear correlation between Bitcoin prices and social media sentiment. Negative sentiment led to a fall in prices, while positive sentiment induced by Twitter influencers with huge followings led to a rise in prices. We visualized these patterns using tools like PowerBI.

Overall, our project demonstrated the potential of social media sentiment analysis in predicting cryptocurrency prices and showcased our expertise in advanced data preprocessing and modeling techniques.
