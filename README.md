# Bitcoin-price-forecasting-using-twitter-sentiment

Are you intrigued by the idea of predicting Bitcoin prices using social media sentiment analysis? Our team embarked on a fascinating project that involved collecting over 107,000 tweets per minute interval from January to September 2020 and preprocessed them using advanced techniques like Vader sentiment analysis and keyword extraction. 

Our aim was to prepare the data for modeling and to do so, we resampled it at 8-hour intervals and converted it into a supervised dataset, using features like opening and closing prices, user follower count, user friend count, and sentiment score. We then used deep learning techniques like Recurrent neural networks (RNN) and Long short term memory (LSTM) to predict future prices based on past data.

Our analysis led us to discover a clear correlation between Bitcoin prices and social media sentiment. Negative sentiment led to a fall in prices, while positive sentiment induced by Twitter influencers with huge followings led to a rise in prices. We visualized these patterns using state-of-the-art tools like PowerBI, resulting in captivating and insightful graphics.

Overall, our project demonstrates the potential of social media sentiment analysis in predicting cryptocurrency prices and showcases our team's proficiency in advanced data preprocessing and modeling techniques. It's a great example of how cutting-edge technology can be leveraged to gain valuable insights and make informed decisions.
